# Trip Advisor Application using React and APIs 

1. In this application, we have an entire google map search where we can search any place in the world, and it will show all the locations
   which are related to that search term.

2. When we search for a particular place, it will show on left side in a card with all restaurants, their reviews, ratings, with all 
   available dishes which are preparing. Card will also show the specialities of the restaurant, phone numbers, and address.

3. When we click on any of the resaurant card, we will be redirected to the trip advisor page where we can see all reviews.

4. We can also visit their website and filter restaurants by their ratings.

5. This application not only consider restaurants but it also includes hotels, and attractions with the same functionality which we have seen in the restaurant portion.

6. When we move the map, locations are brows by their own and displayed on the map again. We can zoom in to see more locations/restaurants/hotels.

7. We can select a particular card on the map and click on it and it will automatically show that card on the left side.

8. We also have implemented the weather API to see the real weather for visitors on all locations.
